                        <p>Australian hospitals and aged care facilities rely on bedpan washer-disinfectors as a cornerstone of infection control. These machines ensure reusable bedpans, commode pans, and urinal bottles are safely cleaned and thermally disinfected after each use, protecting patients and staff from pathogens like C. difficile and MRSA. However, operating these units can be resource-intensive using significant water and energy to achieve the high temperatures and thorough rinsing required for hygiene. With growing emphasis on sustainability in healthcare, facility managers and clinicians are seeking strategies to reduce water and energy waste in these reprocessing cycles without compromising infection prevention. This whitepaper outlines best practices and innovations to optimize bedpan washer cycles, discusses reuse technologies e.g. greywater recycling and heat recovery, and reviews relevant Australian standards and guidelines. The goal is to provide practical recommendations that improve efficiency and cut utility costs while maintaining compliance with strict infection control requirements.</p>

                    <article id="cycle-optimisation" class="mb-4">
                        <p class="h3 section-anchor">Cycle Optimisation: Time, Temperature and Detergent Best Practices</p>
                        <p>Optimizing the washer-disinfector cycle parameters is the first step in minimizing resource waste. Australian infection control guidelines recommend using automated washer-disinfectors for items like bedpans specifically because they deliver reliable cleaning at preset high temperatures and defined times with detergent, reducing manual handling risks. Key best practices include:</p>
                        <p><strong>Use Appropriate Temperature &amp; Time:</strong> Run cycles at the lowest effective temperature and duration that still achieve required disinfection. Thermal disinfection standards per AS/NZS 4187 / AS 5369 and ISO 15883 typically require reaching ≥80 to 90 °C for a specified hold time to attain a sufficient microbiocidal effect often quantified as an A_0 value ≥600. Exceeding these requirements unnecessarily e.g. running at maximum temperature or extra-long hold times “just in case” wastes energy without significant benefit. Modern machines often let users adjust the disinfection level; for instance, cycles can be configured to just meet the needed A_0 value rather than defaulting to the maximum, thereby saving energy. In practice, a cycle achieving about 90 °C for one minute or equivalent is usually adequate for bedpan sanitation, so avoid extending it unless a higher level of disinfection is clinically indicated.</p>
                        <p><strong>Optimize Wash Phases and Detergent Use:</strong> Bedpan washers typically include a flush, wash with detergent, rinse, and sometimes drying phase. To minimise water use, ensure each phase is efficient. Use the recommended detergent type and dose as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Australian guidance specifies using a neutral pH detergent in these machines. Proper dosing is important: too little detergent can lead to poor soil removal potentially requiring re-washing, whereas too much can cause excessive foaming that necessitates extra rinsing. Many modern washer-disinfectors have automatic dosing systems, these should be calibrated regularly for accuracy. The detergent should be introduced at the appropriate hot-water stage for optimal cleaning, as per the machine’s design. In essence, let the chemistry do its work so the machine doesn’t have to compensate with longer cycle times or hotter water than necessary.</p>
                        <p><strong>Avoid Overloading &amp; Underloading:</strong> Loading technique directly impacts both cleaning efficacy and resource use. Australian infection control guidelines emphasize not overloading washers so that all item surfaces contact the detergent solution and wash spray. An overfilled chamber may require repeat cycles and wasting water/energy due to missed soiling. Conversely, running a nearly empty machine is inefficient. Plan workflows so that each cycle processes a reasonable load, for example, one bedpan plus accompanying urinal bottles or other items, up to the machine’s capacity. Most hospital-grade bedpan washers can handle multiple pieces per cycle e.g. one bedpan + two urinals. Utilize that capacity to maximise the output per unit of water and energy. A modern trend is increasing chamber capacity, which lowers the per-item resource usage by cleaning more items in one run. In wards, staff should coordinate to run the washer once a patient’s used items are ready rather than doing them one by one immediately where clinically feasible, without compromising infection control. Soiled items should still be processed promptly, but an extra urinal bottle can be combined with a bedpan in the same load when timing allows.</p>
                        <p><strong>Select Efficient Cycle Programs:</strong> Take advantage of any “eco” or short-cycle modes provided on the washer. Many current bedpan washer-disinfectors include multiple cycle options for different soil levels. For instance, some devices feature pre-set ECO programs that cut water and energy consumption by ~30% compared to standard cycles. These eco-cycles typically use slightly lower wash temperatures or shorter overall cycle times, and are suitable for light soiling or routine disinfection when high-level infectious risks are not present. For example, a light-use urinal bottle might be adequately cleaned with a gentler cycle than a heavily soiled bedpan from an infectious patient. Staff should be trained to choose the appropriate cycle for the task using intensive programs only when needed and defaulting to eco-mode for normal operations. Over a large number of cycles, this optimization significantly reduces total water heated and cycle duration without compromising outcomes.</p>
                        <p><strong>Consider Chemical-Assist Disinfection if Appropriate:</strong> While thermal disinfection is standard, in some cases chemical disinfectants can be used in conjunction with washing to allow lower temperature cycles. The Australian guidelines acknowledge that a TGA-approved disinfectant used in an automated washer can achieve the required disinfection at lower heat. For example, a cycle at ~60 °C with an appropriate chemical e.g. peracetic acid or chlorine-based disinfectant could replace a 90 °C thermal cycle substantially saving energy. If your washer-disinfector supports a chemical disinfection cycle, evaluate this option for situations where heat-sensitive items are processed or where energy conservation is critical. Keep in mind chemical disinfection may require thorough rinsing to remove residue, so ensure the cycle design still minimizes water use and that staff handle and dispose of chemicals safely. Any chemical-use cycle must also be validated to meet the required microbiological kill levels per standards.</p>
                        <p><strong>Routine Maintenance for Efficiency:</strong> An often overlooked but crucial practice is maintenance of the washer-disinfector. A poorly maintained machine can waste water and energy, for instance, clogged spray nozzles or filters reduce cleaning efficiency leading to repeat cycles or longer cycles, and scale build-up on heating elements greatly lowers thermal efficiency using more electricity to heat water. Facility managers should institute regular descaling, cleaning of strainers and jets, and preventive maintenance checks. Modern washers sometimes include automated de-scaling or self-cleaning programs and diagnostic alerts. Use these features to keep the machine running optimally. A well-maintained bedpan washer not only lasts longer but also continues to perform at its design efficiency levels, meaning it uses the minimum water and power necessary per cycle throughout its lifespan.</p>
                        <p>By implementing these cycle optimisations, right cycle selection, correct loading, proper detergent use, and maintenance, hospitals and care facilities can significantly reduce waste. Efficient wash mechanisms with the right water temperature and spray targeting can “provide the best cleaning results with no waste of water”. In summary, only use as much time, heat, and detergent as needed to do the job, no more, no less.</p>

                        <p class="h3 section-anchor">Reuse Technologies: Greywater Recycling and Heat Recovery Systems</p>
                        <p>Beyond optimising the cycle itself, substantial resource savings can be achieved through reuse and recovery technologies. These approaches target the water and heat that would otherwise go down the drain or be lost to the atmosphere during each cycle:</p>
                        <p><strong>Greywater/Recycled Water Use:</strong> One strategy is to supply washer-disinfectors with non-potable water where regulations permit for certain cycle phases. Many Australian hospitals are installing on-site water recycling systems that treat greywater from sinks, showers, etc. to a safe standard for non-drinking uses. This reclaimed water, or harvested rainwater, can potentially be used for the initial flush and wash phases of bedpan cleaning. Since bedpan washers deal with contaminated waste classified as blackwater when drained, any water fed into them for flushing will become sewage; therefore using precious drinking-quality water for this purpose is wasteful if a safe alternative supply exists. By plumbing washers to a recycled water supply line the same used for toilet flushing in some facilities, hospitals can dramatically cut potable water consumption. The Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling note that even greywater used within 24 hours may need little treatment for uses like toilet flushing, but blackwater does require treatment before reuse. In practice, this means the facility should treat greywater to an appropriate level per state regulations and the Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling before using it in washer-disinfectors, and ensure there is no cross-connection between reclaimed water and drinking water lines to maintain safety. Some hospitals have successfully implemented systems where recycled water is used for sluice flushes and then sent to sewer, reducing overall freshwater demand. Facility managers should consult plumbing codes and safety guidelines before retrofitting such solutions, but the potential water savings are significant, especially in water-scarce regions.</p>
                        <p><strong>Wastewater Heat Recovery:</strong> Bedpan washer cycles consume energy largely to heat water and generate steam for thermal disinfection. Instead of letting that heat energy literally go “down the drain” with the effluent, facilities can employ heat recovery systems. A simple heat-exchanger can be integrated into the washer’s drain line or the utility room’s plumbing: as the machine dumps hot wastewater, the exchanger transfers heat from the outgoing dirty water to pre-warm the incoming clean water. Studies of hospital washer-disinfectors have found that their largest energy demand is heating water and steam, and thus “tank systems allow reuse of the hot water from the disinfection phase” and wastewater heat recovery can yield substantial savings. For example, one approach uses a storage tank to collect the final hot rinse water which is typically clean except for heat and reuse it for the next cycle’s pre-wash or wash stage. This reduces the energy needed to heat the next load. Additionally, dedicated drain water heat recovery units or even small heat-pump systems can pull thermal energy from the effluent. According to engineering analyses, recovering heat from wastewater can provide on the order of 15 kWh of energy per cubic meter of water for a ~25°C drop in water temperature, which at scale and current energy prices yields real cost savings. In practical terms, a heat exchanger on a bedpan washer could preheat cold inlet water e.g. from 20°C up to 40 to 50°C using the 90°C wastewater, thereby cutting the electrical or steam heating load by a third or more. Some best-in-class washer-disinfectors now come with built-in heat recovery modules as an option, markedly lowering their operational energy use. Facility managers renovating sluice rooms should consider specifying machines with this feature or retrofitting an external heat recovery system to existing units.</p>
                        <p><strong>Steam Condensing and Heat Reuse:</strong> Related to drain heat recovery is steam/vent heat capture. When a bedpan washer runs a hot cycle, steam often is vented at cycle end or when the door opens, wasting latent heat. Advanced models address this by condensing the steam internally, cooling it and recovering its heat into the water system. For example, one manufacturer’s design includes a “unique heat exchanging system” that not only prevents steam escape but also uses it to preheat incoming water. This improves the room environment (no billowing hot vapors) and recycles energy. If your facility’s current equipment vents a lot of hot steam, it may be worth installing a room heat recovery ventilator or a condensing hood that captures that energy to pre-warm water or air. Though a smaller contribution compared to water heat, every bit helps to reduce HVAC loads and energy waste.</p>
                        <p><strong>On-Demand Water Heating vs Storage:</strong> Traditional washer-disinfectors often have internal boilers or hot tanks kept ready at all times. This standby heating can waste energy during idle periods. One innovation is using on-demand water heaters or “flash” heaters in the washer that heat water only when a cycle runs, or well-insulated small boilers that heat very quickly. Ensuring your machine’s hot water system is modern and well-insulated will reduce standing heat losses. Similarly, if the facility has a central efficient hot water supply e.g. a gas or solar-boosted system, connecting the washer to an external hot water line instead of using its internal heater for all heating can leverage that efficiency. For instance, using centrally solar-heated water at 60°C for the wash fill means the machine’s heater only needs to boost the final disinfection phase from 60° to 90°C instead of heating from 15° to 90°C, a significant energy saving.</p>
                        <p>In implementing reuse technologies, safety and compliance must remain paramount. Any greywater or recycled water use should meet the health regulations e.g. colored/purple piping, backflow prevention, proper treatment levels, since these machines directly contact human waste and then must render items safe for patient reuse. Similarly, modifications like heat exchangers should be done with manufacturer consultation or proven designs to avoid disrupting the validated cleaning process for example, not cooling the wastewater below required drain temperatures needed to prevent biofilm in plumbing. Done properly, greywater integration and heat recovery can dramatically reduce both water consumption and energy bills, turning what used to be waste into a resource.</p>

                        <p class="h3 section-anchor">Compliance with Australian Standards and Guidelines</p>
                        <p><strong>AS/NZS 4187:2014 and AS 5369:2023</strong> are the primary standards for reprocessing of reusable medical devices (RMDs) in healthcare. AS/NZS 4187:2014 (and its amendments up to 2019) has been the benchmark in hospitals for cleaning, disinfecting and sterilizing reusable instruments and equipment. In 2023, it was superseded by AS 5369:2023, which expanded and updated the requirements. AS 5369:2023 is described as a “critical standard focusing on reprocessing of reusable medical devices in both health and non-health-related facilities,” providing updated guidance to ensure devices including bedpans and related items are properly cleaned, disinfected and sterilised to prevent infections and improve patient safety. Notably, this new standard explicitly covers “other devices in health and non-health facilities,” clarifying that even items not traditionally considered surgical instruments, e.g. bedpans, urinals, cleaning accessories must be reprocessed according to validated protocols. In fact, guidance from NSW health authorities on the standard confirms that reusable items like bedpans are expected to comply with AS 5369:2023 processes. For facility managers, this means any cycle modifications or equipment changes must still achieve the outcomes specified by the standard e.g. the required microbicidal effectiveness, cleaning performance, and documented validation. AS 5369 and AS 4187 also reference the international standard ISO 15883 for washer-disinfectors, which includes specific performance requirements and test methods for bedpan washers (ISO 15883-3). Compliance with these standards is mandatory in practice, any water/energy-saving strategy must be consistent with delivering an effective thermal disinfection typically A_0 ≥600 or an equivalent level per the standard. Managers should ensure their bedpan washers are validated e.g. thermally mapped and microbiologically tested when installed or after major changes, to confirm that even with eco-friendly tweaks, the disinfection remains fully effective.</p>
                        <p><strong>Australian Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of Infection in Healthcare (2019),</strong> Published by the NHMRC and ACSQHC, this national guideline provides best-practice recommendations for all aspects of infection prevention. It supports the use of automated washer-disinfectors for reusable equipment to reduce infection risks. The guidelines reiterate that washer-disinfectors “use detergent solutions at predetermined high temperatures and time periods to clean reusable medical devices” and caution that proper loading and not overloading are important so that cleaning is effective. Thus, from a compliance perspective, overloading a machine to save water would violate these guidelines since it could compromise cleaning. The guidelines also mention that manual cleaning should only be done when absolutely necessary for fragile items or lack of automation. In general, automated washing is preferred because it achieves more consistent high temperatures and reduces staff exposure. Our recommendations align with this: any water/energy saving approach should never revert to manual cleaning of bedpans, as that would significantly raise infection risk, manual cleaning cannot achieve the >80 °C thermal kill and tends to spread contamination. Instead, efficiency must come from better use of the machines, not from avoiding their use.</p>
                        <p><strong>NSQHS Standards especially Standard 3 (Preventing and Controlling Infections) </strong> are the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards that require health facilities to have effective infection control systems. Standard 3 mandates proper cleaning and reprocessing of reusable items and appropriate infrastructure. While it doesn’t dictate technical cycle parameters, it implies that equipment should be used according to best practice and maintained to function correctly. Initiatives to save water and energy should be documented in the facility’s infection control and environmental sustainability policies, ensuring they do not conflict with patient safety. For example, using recycled water in a washer would need a risk assessment and likely sign-off by infection control committees to ensure no risk of cross-contamination with appropriate filters and monitoring in place.</p>
                        <p><strong>Aged Care-Specific Guidance:</strong> In residential aged care homes, the environment and resources differ from acute hospitals. The Aged Care IPC Guide (2023) also endorses automated bedpan washers for any reusable bedpans/urinals in use, for improved hygiene. It notes that neutral detergents should be used and again stresses loading technique. Aged care providers should follow the same AS 5369 standard if they reprocess devices on-site. Additionally, they need to ensure staff are trained in these processes, as staff turnover or limited technical expertise can be a challenge in smaller facilities. Any energy/water-saving measures in such settings like using an eco cycle should be clearly written into facility protocols so that new or casual staff don’t inadvertently revert to unsafe practices.</p>
                        <p>In summary, Australian standards and guidelines do not oppose efficiency improvements, in fact, they encourage innovation as long as core disinfection outcomes are met. Always verify that any cycle modifications or new technologies are validated against AS 5369/ISO 15883 performance criteria. Most reputable modern equipment will advertise compliance e.g. being tested by a NATA-accredited lab to ISO 15883 and AS standards and offer features like print-outs or electronic logs for each cycle to prove parameters were reached. Compliance also entails routine performance testing: for instance, using challenge test soils or biological indicators periodically to ensure the washer-disinfector is truly cleaning as expected. This kind of quality assurance should continue even as you implement water/energy-saving strategies, to provide confidence that “efficiency” is not coming at the cost of efficacy.</p>

                    <article id="best-in-class" class="mb-4">
                        <p class="h3 section-anchor">Best-in-Class Technologies and Emerging Innovations</p>
                        <p>The good news for facility managers and clinicians is that washer-disinfector technology has advanced significantly. Today’s best-in-class bedpan washers are far more efficient than older models, and new innovations promise further gains. This section highlights current features and emerging trends mentioned in generic terms, without endorsing specific brands:</p>
                        <p><strong>Intelligent Cycle Control:</strong> Modern washer-disinfectors often incorporate microprocessor controls and sensors that adjust the cycle in real time. For example, “smart wash” systems monitor factors like water pressure, spray arm resistance, or even water turbidity to ensure optimum water distribution and cleaning without excess. Some machines can detect a light vs heavy load and alter the wash time or number of rinse cycles accordingly. This means the machine only uses as much water and time as needed for the specific load, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. Advanced software also allows configurable programs as noted earlier, operators can select or customize cycles for specific needs. Best-in-class units may come with a range of pre-set cycles e.g. quick rinse, standard wash, intensive disinfect, C. diff spore cycle and also let technicians fine-tune parameters, giving flexibility to balance efficiency with disinfection level. Embracing these programmable features allows a facility to, for instance, introduce a water-saving cycle for routine cases while still having a more aggressive cycle available for outbreak situations.</p>
                        <p><strong>Eco-Friendly Cycle Options:</strong> Nearly all top manufacturers now tout eco-friendly features. These include the ECO cycles mentioned which can reduce water and energy use by ~30%, as well as design improvements like efficient spray nozzle geometry and optimized chamber design. A well-designed machine uses targeted high-pressure jets and rotating nozzles to cover all surfaces of the bedpan with minimal water. One example from industry: an effective nozzle layout combined with the right water temperature yields thorough cleaning “with no waste of water”, indicating how engineering is eliminating dead zones and redundant water usage. Another feature is “zero-steam” doors or vapor condensation as discussed, keeping heat in the system. Some machines also have double-walled insulation to retain heat in the chamber during the cycle, so less energy is needed to maintain temperatures. When evaluating new units, look for those with an explicit focus on low water consumption e.g. some advertise using as little as ~20 liters per cycle, versus older models that used 40+ liters and energy-efficient ratings. In fact, a new generation of bedpan washers introduced in recent years claim 30%+ improvements in water and energy efficiency over their predecessors, a testament to how quickly the technology is improving.</p>
                        <p><strong>Larger Capacity and Load Flexibility:</strong> As mentioned, newer machines often can handle more items per cycle e.g. two bedpans or several bottles at once. This not only improves throughput in busy wards but also lowers per-item resource use. Adjustable racks and modular holders are an innovation allowing various item configurations, for instance, a rack might accommodate a single large slipper pan or convert to hold multiple smaller items in one go. By maximizing the useful load each time, water and energy overheads which are mostly fixed per cycle are amortized over more pieces. Facilities should ensure they purchase racks or adapters that suit the mix of items they need to process, to avoid running half-empty cycles because items don’t fit well together.</p>
                        <p><strong>Thermal Heat Recovery and Insulation:</strong> Some high-end washer-disinfectors come with built-in heat recovery units as an option. These use a heat exchanger, often a stainless steel coil or plate exchanger to transfer heat from outgoing drain water to incoming fresh water. In essence, the machine recycles its own heat each cycle. There are also models that use a small heat pump to extract heat from waste water or the hot vapors and reuse it. Effectively turbo-charging the heat recovery beyond passive exchange. Additionally, improved insulation on boilers and chambers and better thermal sealing on doors reduce standing losses. When comparing models, ask for data on water consumption per cycle (in liters) and energy consumption per cycle (in kWh or MJ); the best-in-class will have notably lower numbers due to these features.</p>
                        <p><strong>Automated Drying with Energy Save:</strong> Many modern bedpan washers incorporate a drying cycle using hot air to ensure items come out dry since moisture can breed bacteria if items are stored. To save energy, advanced dryers use features like heat-recovery in the drying air and high-efficiency fans. For example, heat recycling in dryer systems can cut the electricity needed for drying while still delivering completely dry utensils. Some systems use residual heat from the wash water to preheat drying air. If full drying is not critical for your use-case, say, if items are used immediately or one could allow them to air dry, machines often allow the drying phase to be turned off or shortened another way to reduce energy usage when appropriate.</p>
                        <p><strong>Hygiene Monitoring and Cycle Traceability:</strong> While not directly about water/energy, a notable innovation is built-in data loggers and connectivity. Modern machines can log each cycle’s details (temperatures reached, cycle length, any warnings) and some can be connected to facility networks or USB for downloading logs. This helps ensure the machine operates at peak performance and any deviation might indicate a maintenance issue affecting efficiency. It also aids in compliance audits. Some even have remote monitoring, so a maintenance team can spot if a heating element is struggling using more power than usual or if water consumption spiked, and fix problems proactively.</p>
                        <p><strong>Specialty Cycles (C. diff program, etc.):</strong> As an innovation, some washers feature a dedicated Clostridium difficile cycle which usually means an extra-high disinfection setting to kill hardy spores. While such a cycle might consume more water/energy, its availability means you don’t have to over-design every cycle for the worst-case scenario. You can reserve the resource-intensive cycle for when it’s truly needed e.g. a patient with C. diff, and use milder cycles for routine use. This targeted approach is both effective and efficient overall.</p>
                        <p><strong>Materials and Design for Efficiency:</strong> The use of stainless steel with smooth, rounded chamber designs aids both infection control and efficiency. Smooth surfaces drain water better so less water is retained requiring evaporation and clean faster. Also, durable construction means the machine maintains performance over time. Some new designs incorporate antimicrobial coatings or UV self-disinfection features for the chamber and waste trap, which can reduce biofilm build-up and keep efficiency high between manual clean-outs. Additionally, features like automated scale removal, e.g. periodic flushing of the boiler with a descaling agent, or special electrodes that minimize scale deposition keep the heating elements running optimally. These engineering considerations all contribute to sustained low resource usage.</p>
                        <p><strong>Emerging Innovations:</strong> Looking ahead, we see experimentation with ultrasonic cleaning in bedpan washers to augment mechanical spray action, which could potentially shorten wash times or reduce water needed by dislodging soil with sound waves. Other ideas include integrating ozone or UV disinfection to lower reliance on hot water (though currently thermal disinfection is the gold standard for human waste containers). Robotics is also emerging. For instance, automated guided vehicles that collect used bedpans and dock into a cleaning unit, optimizing batch loads. While these are early-stage, they reflect a trend of using technology to both improve infection control and drive efficiency.</p>
                        <p>In sum, the state-of-the-art bedpan washer-disinfector is a highly efficient machine with smart controls, eco-cycle options, heat and water recovery features, and robust design to maintain performance. When replacing or upgrading equipment, facilities should include energy and water efficiency criteria in their procurement specifications. Ask vendors about compliance to ISO 15883 standards and about consumption figures and green features, for example, does the unit “minimise water and energy consumption” as part of its design?. Investing in a quality machine with these features not only supports sustainability goals but often pays back in reduced utility costs over its lifespan. One case example noted a new model was about 33% more water and energy efficient than the one it replaced, which over thousands of cycles per year is a substantial saving. Embracing these innovations allows healthcare facilities to stay at the forefront of both infection control and environmental responsibility.</p>

                        <p class="h3 section-anchor">Practical Recommendations for Facility Managers and Clinicians</p>
                        <p>Finally, we translate the above strategies into practical, implementable recommendations for those on the ground, the facility managers overseeing equipment and the clinicians or support staff who use it. By following these recommendations, healthcare facilities can achieve meaningful reductions in water and energy usage during bedpan reprocessing, while upholding the highest standards of hygiene and safety:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Develop Clear Protocols for Efficient Use:</strong> Create or update written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for bedpan washer-disinfectors that include guidance on resource-efficient operation. For example, protocols should instruct staff on: selecting the appropriate cycle type (normal vs. eco vs. intensive) for each situation; loading the machine to optimal capacity; and avoiding practices like running the machine for a single small item if it can be combined. Ensure these SOPs are aligned with manufacturer instructions and infection control policies. By formalizing such practices, you make efficient operation the default behavior.</li>
                            <li><strong>Train and Engage Staff:</strong> Proper use of technology hinges on user behavior. Conduct training sessions with nurses, orderlies, and cleaning staff on the do’s and don’ts of loading and running the washer. Emphasize that overloading is counterproductive, items won’t clean properly, wasting a repeat cycle and underloading is wasteful. Teach them about any eco-programs or special features of your machines. For instance, demonstrate the difference between the “Standard 90°C” cycle and the “Eco” cycle in terms of runtime and water use, so they appreciate the impact. Engage staff by sharing metrics: e.g., “Last month we saved 500 liters of water by using the short cycle for lightly soiled items.” This can motivate continued compliance. Also include training on any new technologies. If you install a recycled water system or a heat recovery unit, explain to staff that these are in place and why, so they understand the facility’s sustainability initiatives and their role in it. Clinicians should also be educated that using bedpan washers properly is part of patient safety. For instance, a nurse should know not to bypass the washer for speed by manually rinsing a bedpan which would both increase infection risk and possibly use more water. Strong leadership support for these practices, as part of a “green and safe healthcare” culture, will reinforce their importance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Optimize Scheduling and Workflows:</strong> Work with nursing unit managers to integrate bedpan reprocessing into daily workflows efficiently. For instance, if possible, time the use of washers to coincide with periods of lower demand for hot water or power in the facility. Some hospitals avoid running heavy equipment at peak energy tariff times. In a ward, coordinate so that one nurse can load the washer with items from multiple patients at once, using appropriate precautions to avoid cross-contamination, such as only processing items from the same isolation status together. Ensure there are enough bedpans in rotation so that staff do not feel pressured to run half-empty cycles due to needing a quick turnaround of a single item. A simple queue system or bin for “ready to wash” items can help consolidate loads. However, be mindful not to delay processing beyond safe limits. Infectious waste should still be dealt with promptly, so this is about fine-tuning, not introducing unsafe wait times.</li>
                            <li><strong>Maintain and Monitor Equipment Regularly:</strong> As a facility manager, set up a preventive maintenance schedule specifically for washer-disinfectors. This includes regular descaling especially in areas with hard water, perhaps monthly or per manufacturer guidance and cleaning of spray nozzles, strainers, and drains. Keep a log of maintenance activities and any performance tests done. Additionally, leverage the machine’s monitoring capabilities: review the cycle log printouts or digital reports periodically to catch any anomalies e.g., a pattern of longer cycle times could indicate a heating element issue. Some facilities assign a specific staff member e.g. an environmental services supervisor or nurse to do a daily quick-check: verify detergent levels so dosing is correct, check that the washer’s self-disinfection cycle if it has run successfully, and ensure no error codes are showing. By keeping the machine in top condition, you maintain its efficiency. A well-tuned machine is an efficient machine.</li>
                            <li><strong>Implement Water and Energy Reuse Projects in Stages:</strong> If considering larger infrastructure changes like greywater recycling or heat recovery, approach them methodically. Conduct a feasibility study: measure how much water and heat your bedpan washers currently use, many machines can report water consumption per cycle, or you can meter the supply line. This gives a baseline to estimate savings. Consult with engineers and refer to resources like the Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling to design a safe reuse system. For example, you might start by using reclaimed water for toilet flushing in a new wing, then extend that supply to the sluice room washers once it’s proven. Similarly, a heat exchanger could be piloted on one washer before rolling out broadly. Ensure any such system is validated, e.g., test the microbiological quality of recycled water periodically, and confirm that heat recovery doesn’t interfere with the thermal disinfection. The final rinse should still exit hot enough not to encourage microbial growth in plumbing. By rolling out in stages, you can troubleshoot issues and demonstrate success, which makes it easier to get buy-in for broader implementation. Do involve infection control committees and risk management in these projects from the beginning, to address any concerns and meet regulatory requirements.</li>
                            <li><strong>Measure, Benchmark, and Feedback:</strong> “You can’t improve what you don’t measure.” Start tracking key metrics: water use possibly via meter readings or utility bills and energy use from power bills or any sub-metering for the utility rooms or washers. If your hospital participates in sustainability benchmarking like NABERS for hospitals which includes energy/water efficiency ratings, use that framework to set targets for reduction. Even informally, you might calculate water per bedpan decontamination cycle and try to bring it down over time. Provide feedback to staff and leadership: e.g. “This quarter, through efficient bedpan reprocessing, we saved X liters of water and Y kWh of energy, equivalent to Z dollars and conserving valuable resources.” Recognize units or teams that excel in implementing the practices. Perhaps an internal award or acknowledgment for a ward that consistently runs full loads and uses eco cycles properly. This not only reinforces the behaviors but also highlights the co-benefit of sustainability efforts, often they save money that can be redirected to patient care.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stay Updated on Technology and Standards:</strong> The landscape of infection control technology is always evolving. Facility managers should stay informed about any updates to Australian standards or guidelines, for example, any amendments to AS 5369 or new guidance from NSW Health or the ACSQHC on environmental sustainability in infection control. Likewise, keep an eye on new equipment offerings: if your washers are over a decade old, they may lack the efficiencies of current models. It may be cost-effective in the long run to replace an old water-guzzling washer with a new high-efficiency model, rather than continuing to pay high running costs. Do lifecycle cost analyses when budgeting for capital equipment, factoring in water and energy consumption vendors can provide those figures, e.g., liters per cycle, kW per cycle for comparison. Additionally, participate in knowledge-sharing through forums like the Sterilising Research &amp; Advisory Council or healthcare facility management conferences to learn from other facilities’ success stories in reducing resource use. For instance, one hospital might share how they retrofitted heat exchangers and cut energy by X%, another might present on switching to recycled water for flushing. Such case studies can provide practical tips and confidence in implementing similar measures in your facility.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>By following these recommendations, both the technical management and the day-to-day usage of bedpan washer-disinfectors will align towards minimal waste. The overarching principle is efficiency with accountability: use the machines to their full potential for infection control, but do so smartly and responsibly with respect to resources. Australia’s healthcare facilities can thus lead by example, demonstrating that sustainability and safety can go hand in hand. Every liter of water saved and every kilowatt-hour conserved contributes not only to financial savings and environmental protection, but also to a resilient healthcare system that judiciously manages its resources for the benefit of the community.</p>

                        <p class="h3 section-anchor">Conclusion</p>
                        <p>Minimising water and energy waste in bedpan washer-disinfector cycles is an achievable goal that resonates with both the environmental stewardship values of the Australian healthcare system and its uncompromising commitment to infection control. By implementing cycle optimisations right time, temperature, and detergent practices, leveraging reuse technologies like greywater recycling and heat recovery, and investing in modern high-efficiency equipment, facilities can significantly reduce their resource footprint. Crucially, all these efforts must be framed within the context of Australian standards (AS 5369/AS 4187 and national IPC guidelines). Ensuring that efficiency measures reinforce, not hinder, compliance and patient safety. Current best-in-class technologies offer exciting opportunities to maintain hygiene standards with far less water and energy, and emerging innovations hold promise for even greater gains in the near future.</p>
                        <p>For facility managers, the challenge lies in translating these technical strategies into everyday practice through sound policies, staff training, and continuous improvement. For clinicians and care staff, it means embracing new procedures and being vigilant that infection prevention remains robust even as processes become more sustainable. The recommendations provided here serve as a roadmap for both groups to collaborate in optimizing their sluice room operations. In doing so, hospitals and aged care facilities can reduce operating costs and environmental impact, particularly important in Australia’s climate of frequent droughts and the push for carbon reduction, while upholding the quality of care. Essentially, “green” solutions in reprocessing can be a win-win, supporting healthcare’s healing mission in both patient outcomes and planetary health.</p>
                        <p>By following the strategies outlined in this whitepaper, Australian healthcare facilities can lead the way in efficient, eco-conscious infection control. Every saved watt and drop is a step toward a more sustainable health system. And as shown, these savings come not at the expense of safety or compliance, but through smarter adherence to best practices and innovative use of technology. The result is a cleaner, safer environment for patients and staff, and a cleaner, safer environment beyond the hospital walls as well.</p>
