                        <p>Compliance monitoring in sterilisation and disinfection processes is critical for patient safety. Autoclaves (steam sterilisers) and washer-disinfectors are regularly tested using chemical indicators (CIs), devices that undergo a physical or chemical change when exposed to specified process parameters e.g. time, temperature, presence of steam or chemical disinfectant. These indicators provide quick visual confirmation that a process has occurred and help verify that critical conditions for sterilisation or disinfection were met. However, not all chemical indicators are equal. They are categorized by classes (Class 1 through 6) according to international/Australian standards, with higher classes generally giving more detailed information about the process. This whitepaper presents a model and manufacturer-agnostic analysis of various chemical indicator classes, evaluating their accuracy, reliability, and cost implications for routine compliance monitoring. Both laboratory performance and real-world clinical use are considered, in alignment with Australian regulations and standards e.g. Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) requirements, AS/NZS 4187, ISO 11140 and ISO 15883, etc.</p>

                        <p>Australian standards and guidelines emphasise a multi-faceted approach to monitoring sterilisation and disinfection, combining physical, chemical, and biological indicators for robust assurance. According to AS/NZS 4187:2014 (Reprocessing of Reusable Medical Devices in Health Service Organizations), every sterilisation cycle should be monitored and recorded. Indeed, AS/NZS 4187 (Section 7) stipulates that a chemical indicator be used with every load and, if applicable, with every item. For steam sterilisation, Australian guidance requires at least a Class 1 process indicator on every package or in every unwrapped load as visible evidence of exposure to a sterilisation process. Higher-class internal indicators (Class 4, 5, or 6) may be placed inside packs for added assurance, though in some office-based practices their use is considered optional if mechanical printout data are available. Australian regulators note that the change in a chemical indicator’s appearance should not be taken as proof of sterility, it only indicates exposure. The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) classifies chemical process indicators as medical devices, usually Class 1 devices on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. All such indicators must meet performance standards e.g. ISO 11140-1 for sterilisation CIs and be used according to manufacturer instructions and relevant guidelines.</p>
                        <p>For washer-disinfectors and chemical disinfection processes, standards like AS/NZS 4187 and ISO 15883 require routine monitoring of cleaning and disinfection efficacy. Chemical indicators e.g. test soil strips or chemical concentration tests are used to validate that required parameters, such as detergent concentration, contact time, and temperature are achieved in each cycle. Each item that has been sterilised or high-level disinfected should have an indicator or tag confirming it has been processed, to distinguish reprocessed items from those not yet processed.</p>

                        <p class="h3">Chemical Indicator Classifications (Classes 1 to 6)</p>
                        <p>Modern standards ISO 11140-1, adopted in Australia via AS/NZS 4187 define six classes of chemical indicators for sterilisation processes primarily steam autoclaving. Each class is designed for a specific purpose and provides a different level of information about the process. Higher-numbered classes generally monitor more sterilisation parameters or have a closer correlation to actual sterilisation conditions than lower classes. The classes are summarized below.</p>

                        <!-- Converted Table 1 into paragraphs -->
                        <div>
                            <p class="h5">Class 1</p>
                            <p><strong>Description (Purpose):</strong> Process Indicator (single-parameter external indicator) e.g. indicator tapes, marks on pouches.</p>
                            <p><strong>Typical Use:</strong> External on every pack or tray in every load to show it was exposed to a process.</p>
                            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Very inexpensive and easy to use and often built into tape or packaging. Clearly distinguishes processed vs. unprocessed items.</p>
                            <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Does not confirm adequate sterilisation, designed to change color under conditions that may be achieved even in an incomplete cycle. Only reacts to one parameter e.g. heat; no insight into time or steam penetration.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="mt-3">
                            <p class="h5">Class 2</p>
                            <p><strong>Description (Purpose):</strong> Specific-Use Indicator, for special tests of autoclave function. The main example is the Bowie-Dick test for steam penetration/air removal in vacuum autoclaves.</p>
                            <p><strong>Typical Use:</strong> Autoclave performance tests e.g. run daily in an empty chamber of pre-vacuum sterilisers. Not used on every pack; used per schedule or validation.</p>
                            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Detects air removal and steam penetration issues and will show if the steriliser fails to remove air pockets, a critical function in pre-vacuum steam sterilisers. Provides a clear pass/fail pattern e.g. uniform color change on a Bowie-Dick sheet indicates proper vacuum function.</p>
                            <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Specific to equipment function and not intended for general pack monitoring. Like Class 1, it is designed to reach its end-point even under some sub-sterilisation conditions; it only challenges air removal, not microbial kill. Used daily or per steriliser manufacturer and adds daily cost. Each single-use Bowie-Dick pack is typically a few dollars.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="mt-3">
                            <p class="h5">Class 3</p>
                            <p><strong>Description (Purpose):</strong> Single-Parameter Indicator designed to react to one critical parameter of sterilisation e.g. a thermometer vial that melts at a certain temperature threshold.</p>
                            <p><strong>Typical Use:</strong> Historically used inside packs or in test loads to verify one aspect e.g. temperature reached somewhere in load. Now largely obsolete in Australian practice, as multi-parameter indicators are preferred.</p>
                            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Simple and specific, can confirm a particular parameter e.g. 134 °C was attained at point X in the chamber.</p>
                            <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Limited value: if time or other conditions were insufficient, a Class 3 may still “pass” since it tracks only one variable. No longer commonly used in Australia given the availability of Classes 4 to 6 which are more informative.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="mt-3">
                            <p class="h5">Class 4</p>
                            <p><strong>Description (Purpose):</strong> Multi-Parameter Indicator reacts to 2 or more parameters e.g. time and temperature. Often an internal strip that changes color only if a combo of conditions are met e.g. at least 134 °C for 3 minutes.</p>
                            <p><strong>Typical Use:</strong> Placed inside packs for pack control, provides extra assurance that adequate conditions were achieved inside the pack.  Especially useful if no electronic printout is available. Often used in general-purpose sterilisation pouches and instrument packs.</p>
                            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> More stringent than Class 1 or 3: will usually only change color if both threshold temperature and minimal exposure time are achieved, giving greater confidence of a successful cycle. Useful backup in case of printer failure and can indicate success in the absence of digital records.</p>
                            <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Does not pinpoint which parameter fell short if it fails and only gives a pass/fail overall. Not as sensitive as Class 5; may reach end-point under a narrower set of sub-conditions, so still possible to have a false “pass” if conditions barely hit the indicator’s stated values.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="mt-3">
                            <p class="h5">Class 5</p>
                            <p><strong>Description (Purpose):</strong> Integrating Indicator reacts to all critical parameters of the sterilisation process including time, temperature, and presence of steam pressure. Often designed to mimic the overall lethality of the process, integrating the exposure into one readout e.g. moving-front indicators that migrate when sufficient heat/steam exposure accumulates.</p>
                            <p><strong>Typical Use:</strong> Used inside packs or as a Process Challenge Device (PCD) for load monitoring. Provides high-level assurance, often used to release loads especially non-implant loads immediately, in between biological indicator tests. E.g. a Class 5 strip inside a test pack may be used each load as a challenge device in lieu of a BI for routine monitoring.</p>
                            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Most accurate of the chemical indicators, designed to parallel the performance of a biological spore test. It reacts to the combination of time, temp, and steam saturation; standards require it be as stringent as or exceed the reference biological indicator’s kill requirements. Gives a clear pass/fail result usually with a distinct color change into an “acceptable” zone, allowing quick interpretation. Can detect steriliser failures or user errors e.g. cold spots from overloading or packaging errors by failing to change color, thereby alerting staff immediately, which improves patient safety and avoids using inadequately processed items.</p>
                            <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Costlier per strip than lower classes. Class 5 integrators typically cost on the order of $0.50 each. Using one inside every pack or every load adds up financially. Still not a biological indicator: it provides high assurance but does not prove sterility viable spores are not involved. Thus it cannot replace routine biological tests, especially for implant loads. Regulations still require weekly BI and use of BI plus CI for implants.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="mt-3">
                            <p class="h5">Class 6</p>
                            <p><strong>Description (Purpose):</strong> Emulating Indicator (Cycle-specific indicator) reacts to all critical parameters of a specified sterilisation cycle e.g. designed for “134 °C, 3.5 min” steam cycle. It “emulates” a particular cycle’s required conditions, offering very precise indication if that exact cycle was achieved.</p>
                            <p><strong>Typical Use:</strong> Used as an internal pack indicator or challenge device for specific cycles. For example, a Class 6 indicator labeled for a 121 °C/15 min cycle will only show acceptable result if exposed to at least those conditions. Provides very high assurance for that cycle type. Often employed when a facility uses one predominant cycle. The Class 6 gives confidence that cycle’s parameters were met each time.</p>
                            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Highly sensitive and precise and gives a strong assurance that all critical conditions of the selected cycle have been met. Can be used in place of Class 5 in some protocols for routine monitoring, and is recognized in ISO standards. Allows tailoring to specific instruments or cycle e.g. if running short flash cycles, an emulating CI for that cycle can closely monitor its adequacy.</p>
                            <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Cycle-specific limitation: A Class 6 is only valid for the exact cycle type it is designed for. If multiple cycle types are used, one must stock different Class 6 indicators for each, adding complexity. Does not correlate across cycles as Class 5 does; also some studies have found that certain Class 6 indicators may still exhibit false positives (show “pass”) under marginal conditions. Example: a 2020 study found a Type 6 CI showed “approved” results in a cycle that actually failed per the steriliser’s printout, suggesting that current Class 6 specifications might not always adequately detect failed conditions. Not universally required by all guidelines e.g. US AAMI standards do not mandate Class 6 use, so their role is sometimes supplementary.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Class 3 single-parameter indicators are largely historical and “no longer used” in many Australian healthcare settings. Classes 4 to 6 are internal indicators for pack or load monitoring; they provide increasingly stringent validation that sterilisation conditions were met. All chemical indicators should be used before their expiration date and checked immediately after the cycle. If you wait too long, the color change can fade or revert, which invalidates the reading. In any case, chemical indicators complement, but do not replace, biological indicators. Biological spore tests remain the gold standard for sterility verification and are required periodically e.g. weekly, and for load qualification of implantable devices.</p>

                        <p class="h3">Performance and Reliability: Laboratory vs Real-World</p>
                        <p>Chemical indicators are manufactured and tested to strict standards in the lab, but their performance in real-world clinical use can be affected by various factors. Under controlled conditions, each class of indicator has defined “stated values”, the exact conditions under which it is designed to change in a predictable way. For example, a Class 5 integrator’s stated value might be exposure equivalent to a 106 spore kill at 121 °C, and it must reliably reach its endpoint only when that condition or greater is achieved. In practice, this means reputable Class 5 indicators are highly sensitive to insufficient time, temperature, or steam, making them very reliable at detecting sub-par cycles. In contrast, many Class 1 process indicators and some Class 2 or 3 indicators are calibrated to change color before full sterilisation conditions are attained, essentially they have a safety margin, turning color after a relatively minimal exposure. This is by design to ensure they will mark items as “processed” even in shorter or cooler cycles, but it also means they can produce false positives: indicating an item was exposed to the process even if the cycle was not sufficient for sterility. As one government guideline bluntly states, “many chemical indicators produce a colour change before minimum sterilization conditions are attained, and thus are only suitable for sorting processed goods from those not yet processed.” In other words, lower-class CIs like most Class 1 tapes should never be relied on alone to verify sterilisation, they might change color in a failed cycle, giving a false sense of security. They serve only as an exposure indicator, not a performance guarantee.</p>
                        <p>Higher-class indicators (Class 4 to 6) are much more trustworthy for performance monitoring, but they too have nuances. Class 4 multi-parameter strips will usually detect significant deviations e.g. not changing color if either time or temp was too low. Class 5 integrators are considered the most accurate chemical proxy for sterilisation, they “very closely mimic biological indicators” by reacting to all three critical variables. In the lab, Class 5 integrators must demonstrate performance equivalent to or exceeding a biological indicator’s requirements, and indeed some are FDA-cleared or TGA-approved as substantially equivalent to spore tests in performance. This means in a well-run steriliser, a Class 5 will almost never show “pass” unless kill conditions were achieved. Many Australian clinics use Class 5 strips in every load especially in challenge packs because they provide immediate cycle-by-cycle feedback, whereas biologicals take 1 to 2 days to incubate. Real-world, this practice reduces the risk of using unsterile items, if any load fails the integrator, it can be pulled and re-sterilised immediately, rather than discovered days later when a weekly spore test comes back positive. Studies and field experience show Class 5 CIs are highly reliable; however, they are not infallible. They must be placed correctly, deep inside a pack or test challenge device that represents the hardest-to-sterilise portion of the load and stored properly indicators can be damaged by improper storage, humidity, or expired reagents. Also, humans must interpret them correctly, some color changes can be subtle, though most integrators today have clear pass or fail markings or moving color bars for unambiguous reading.</p>
                        <p>Class 6 emulating indicators, despite being very stringent for specific cycles, have had some questioning results in practice. The cited 2020 study by Laranjeira found a Class 6 indicator showing a “pass” even though the autoclave cycle failed according to its digital data. The issue appeared to be that the cycle’s parameters fell just below the specification, yet the indicator still met its end-point. This kind of finding suggests that real-world variability, e.g. slow steam penetration, slight superheat, positioning of the indicator can sometimes fool even high-class CIs. It underscores that no single chemical indicator can guarantee sterility hence standards still call for periodic biological challenges as a failsafe.</p>
                        <p>Another reliability factor is result stability: many chemical indicator inks are not permanent. The RACGP notes that the color change should be checked immediately after unloading the steriliser, because the indicator’s color can fade or change upon cooling and over time. If someone examines an indicator hours or days later, they might not get an accurate reading. Good practice is to inspect and record CI results right away and keep the used indicators as part of the cycle record, some even tape the spent internal indicator to the record sheet for documentation. Proper training is needed so staff know what a “pass” vs “fail” looks like for each type of CI, under good lighting. Manufacturer instructions often specify the acceptable color range or reference images. Inconsistency in interpretation can be an issue in busy settings; for example, a slight color change might be misread as full change by one person and not by another. Standardising on indicators with distinct endpoints, and having clear policies e.g. “any doubt equals treat as fail”, can mitigate this human factor.</p>
                        <p>Physical operating conditions can also affect CI performance. Steam chemical indicators assume a certain steam quality presence of saturated steam. If an autoclave has poor steam (wet or superheated steam), or if there is air trapped, an indicator might not reach its endpoint even if temperature was nominally reached because the lack of moisture delays the reaction. Conversely, an indicator might change in a superheated, dry condition that actually is not effective for sterilisation of actual instruments since superheated steam can be less lethal. For this reason, the Bowie-Dick (Class 2) test and others are used to specifically detect those issues of air and steam quality. In a well-functioning steriliser, these are usually non-issues, but if there are problems like air leaks, slow heat-up ramps, or overloading, indicators can behave unexpectedly. One case report found that a Bowie-Dick test showed false passes due to a very slow come-up time on the steriliser, essentially the indicator sheet colorized gradually and appeared uniform even though the process was improper. This kind of anomaly is rare, but it highlights that routine monitoring must be paired with maintenance and validation. Chemical indicators are one piece of the puzzle; steriliser calibration and qualification tests such as thermocouple mappings, leak-rate tests, etc. ensure the equipment can actually meet the parameters that CIs and BIs are checking for.</p>
                        <p><strong>In summary,</strong> under laboratory conditions each CI class performs to its standard specifications. In real-world use, Class 1 and simple indicators often “pass” too easily, whereas Class 4 to 6 indicators provide much greater reliability in detecting inadequate cycles. Even so, user factors such as proper use, prompt reading, avoiding expiration and device factors  such as steriliser functioning correctly are crucial to ensure that the indicators’ readings are meaningful. Australian guidelines currently consider biological indicators the most reliable check of sterilisation process lethality, with chemical indicators as an immediate adjunct for routine load monitoring. Thus, best practice is to use a combination: e.g. every pack has a Class 1 and an internal Class 4 or 5, every day a Bowie-Dick test is run, and weekly a BI is incubated, together providing overlapping assurances that the equipment is performing and the loads are sterile.</p>

                        <p class="h3">Cost Implications of Various Indicators</p>
                        <p>Cost is an important practical factor in selecting indicators for routine monitoring. There is a clear trade-off between indicator sophistication and cost: “the need to sort processed goods… suggests a need for only low cost indicators; the desire for a good indication that sterilization was achieved… suggests a need for the more expensive indicators.” In other words, a strip of autoclave tape (Class 1) costs only a few cents per use, whereas an advanced integrating indicator or enzyme-based test will cost more, but also tell you more. Below is an overview of cost considerations by indicator type:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Class 1 Process Indicators:</strong> These are the cheapest, typically $0.01 to $0.05 per item. For example, indicator tape rolls are inexpensive and one roll can seal and mark hundreds of packs. Self-sealing sterilisation pouches with built-in indicator marks also add only minimal cost per pouch. Given their low cost, using Class 1 on every single item (as required by AS 4187) is economically feasible. Cost impact: negligible per load. E.g. 20 packs in a load equals 20 pieces of tape, maybe $0.50 total.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Class 2 Indicators (Bowie-Dick packs, etc.):</strong> These are moderate cost but used infrequently, typically one test pack per day per vacuum steriliser. A disposable Bowie-Dick test pack might cost around $5 to $10 each (price varies by brand and bulk purchasing). Over a year of daily testing, this can be a few hundred to a thousand dollars per steriliser. This is an accepted cost of doing business for facilities with pre-vacuum autoclaves, as it is a required daily safety check. Alternatives like reusable electronic Bowie-Dick challenge devices have a higher upfront cost but can reduce ongoing expenses. Cost impact: on the order of $1,000 per year per machine for disposables, but ensures critical vacuum function is monitored.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Class 4 Multi-Parameter Strips:</strong> These internal indicators cost more than Class 1, but still relatively low, roughly $0.10 to $0.30 each. Sold in bulk e.g. a pack of 200 strips might be $20 to $40. If one is placed in every pack or every tray, the cost per load scales with the number of items. Some clinics economise by putting a Class 4 in only the hardest-to-sterilise pack of the load rather than every single pack; however, best practice is at least one internal indicator per pack. Assuming 10 packs per load, using one per pack might add $1 to $3 per load in indicator costs. Cost impact: low-to-moderate; a reasonable trade-off for better assurance when printouts are not fully trusted or available.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Class 5 Integrating Indicators:</strong> These are more premium priced, about $0.40 to $0.80 per strip in many markets. One manufacturer notes “the average cost of an integrator strip is less than 50 cents”, which is small in absolute terms but higher than basic strips. If used in every load (or every pack), these costs accumulate. For example, using one Class 5 in each of 5 loads per day ($2.50 per day) would be approximately $50 per month. Many dental and medical offices justify this cost because the Class 5 gives immediate cycle-by-cycle validation, potentially preventing costly mistakes. The cost of a sterilisation failure and subsequent recall of instruments or infection incident far exceeds a few dollars per day. In fact, using integrators routinely can reduce the cost of recalls or re-sterilisation, by catching a steriliser malfunction early, you avoid the scenario of having to recall a whole batch of instruments used over days. As one source points out, integrators used daily or in every load improve patient safety and reduce disruption and cost of recalls when a biological test fails. In other words, they are an insurance policy: “better to be safe than sorry.” Many Australian hospitals and larger clinics include a Class 5 in every load as part of their quality assurance, despite the added expense, because it streamlines load release, especially for non-implant loads which can be released based on the CI result rather than held for BI result).</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Class 6 Emulating Indicators:</strong> These are priced similarly to Class 5 on a per-indicator basis. The main cost issue with Class 6 is that if you run multiple types of cycles, you need to stock multiple versions of the indicator, one for each cycle configuration. If each version is only used a few times, there could be wastage such as indicators expiring before use, etc. For facilities that mostly run one cycle type e.g. always 134 °C for 4 minutes, Class 6 cost is comparable to Class 5. For those with many cycle types, it can become an inventory hassle. In Australia, Class 6 use is not as prevalent as Class 5; many sites opt for the flexibility of Class 5 integrators across all cycles.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Biological Indicators (not chemical, but for context):</strong> BI spore tests cost around $2 to $5 each for self-contained rapid readout types. Since these are done weekly or for certain loads, their ongoing cost is relatively low in total. The cost of incubators and record-keeping exists but is usually justified by the high level of assurance BIs provide. TGA and standards require BIs in specific cases. e.g. every ethylene oxide cycle, periodic steam steriliser tests, so their cost is a necessary part of compliance.</p>

                                <p><strong>Washer-Disinfector Indicators:</strong> Costs here vary by type:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><p><strong>Cleaning efficacy test strips</strong> (synthetic soil indicators) often come in kits of 100; for example, a box of 100 washer test strips might cost on the order of $80 to $150, that is roughly $0.8 to $1.5 each. If used daily, that is $30 a month. Some products also require a reusable holder ($100 one-time). Overall, a daily cleaning indicator program is a modest cost for ensuring instruments are properly cleaned before sterilisation.</p></li>
                                    <li><p><strong>Chemical disinfectant concentration test strips</strong> for washers or high-level disinfectant baths are relatively cheap, perhaps $1 or less per test strip. They are usually used each day or each batch to verify the solution’s potency e.g. test strips for a OPA or chlorine solution in an automatic endoscope reprocessor.</p></li>
                                    <li><p><strong>Thermal-disinfection indicators</strong> (temperature-sensitive stickers that irreversibly change when e.g. 90 °C is reached) also cost around $1 each or less.

                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Given that washer-disinfector failures (poor cleaning) can lead to dangerous soil remaining on instruments, the cost of cleaning indicators is justified by infection control benefits. It is far cheaper to detect a washer issue early, with a $1 indicator than to risk patient exposure to improperly cleaned instruments and subsequent infection or costly outbreak management.</p>
                        <p>In budgeting for compliance monitoring, facilities often use a mix: Class 1 on everything (essential and cheap), Class 5 or 6 in each load (for high assurance), Bowie-Dick daily, and BI weekly. A small clinic might spend only a few hundred dollars a year on indicators, whereas a large hospital CSSD running many sterilisers and washers could spend several thousand. These costs are weighed against the risk and liability costs of not monitoring properly. Notably, Australian accreditation e.g. NSQHS standards and licensing require demonstration of compliance with AS/NZS 4187, failing to use required indicators could cost a facility in terms of non-compliance or, worse, an infection control incident. Therefore, most facilities treat indicator costs as a necessary part of the reprocessing workflow. The procurement of indicators must also ensure they are registered products meeting Australian standards. All chemical indicators used should be TGA-listed and compliant with ISO classes, using cheaper unverified indicators to save money would be false economy and could violate regulations.</p>

                        <p class="h3">Chemical Indicators in Washer-Disinfectors (Cleaning/Disinfection Monitoring)</p>
                        <p>While the classes 1 to 6 above specifically refer to sterilisation (especially steam sterilisation), washer-disinfectors (automated instrument washers that often include a disinfection cycle) also rely on chemical indicators for routine monitoring. The objectives in washer-disinfector monitoring are twofold: verifying cleaning efficacy and verifying disinfection parameters. These indicators do not fall into the same class hierarchy as sterilisation CIs, but they are crucial for compliance with standards like AS/NZS 4187 which references ISO 15883 for washer-disinfector performance.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>1. Cleaning Efficacy Indicators:</strong> These are typically artificial test soils deposited on a surrogate item, which are placed in the washer load to see if the machine effectively removes them. For example, a common design is a plastic or metal strip coated with a dried protein or lipid soil that mimics blood or tissue. After a wash cycle, the strip is examined for residual soil. Complete removal of the test soil indicates proper cleaning, whereas any remaining stain indicates a failure which could be due to improper water spray impingement, blocked jets, insufficient detergent, etc. One such indicator system uses a holder that presents the soil at difficult angles e.g. inside a “V” shape to challenge the washer’s spray coverage. Australian guidelines note that visual inspection of instruments is essential, but these test soils provide a consistent, reproducible challenge beyond what the eye can see on actual instruments. They are used typically daily to verify the washer is performing. For example, the NSW Clinical Excellence Commission recommends daily cleaning efficacy tests and documentation of results for washer-disinfectors. A good cleaning indicator will be sensitive to factors like water temperature, pressure, and detergent action, effectively an analog of how well the mechanical process is running. If a washer’s spray arms are not spinning or if filters are clogged, the test strip will likely still be dirty (failure), alerting staff to troubleshoot. These indicators are usually chemical dyes or proteins that change appearance when hit by water and detergent, making remaining soil easy to spot. They are not measuring microbial kill but rather soil removal, which is a prerequisite to effective disinfection or sterilisation (you cannot sterilise what is not clean). Laboratories have developed standardized test soils e.g. the German soil test, or proteins per ISO 15883-5 to ensure uniform challenges. Studies have compared various washer indicators and found differences in how well they simulate real blood and how sensitive they are to machine variances. The selection of a cleaning indicator should be based on one that is validated for the washer type and soil type of interest, and ideally compliant with standards. Many commercial indicators state they meet ISO or TS 15883-5 guidance for test soils.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>2. Disinfection Process Indicators:</strong> Washer-disinfectors either use high-temperature water (thermal disinfection) or a chemical disinfectant in the final stage. In thermal disinfection, the machine will typically have a printout of temperature achieved e.g. greater than 90 °C for 1 minute, achieving a certain A₀ value. If no printout is available, thermal indicator strips can be placed in the load. These are like small labels that irreversibly change color when a certain temperature is exceeded. Some strips have multiple dots that melt at different temperatures to give a profile of what temp was reached. For instance, a strip might have dots at 65, 75, 85, 93 ° C. After the cycle you can see which dots changed to confirm that the load hit the target range. Such indicators ensure the washer’s heating is functional and that load items indeed experienced the required heat.</p>
                                <p>For chemical disinfection processes e.g. a washer-disinfector using an enzymatic detergent followed by a chemical disinfectant like peracetic acid or glutaraldehyde, chemical concentration indicators are used. These are often simple dip-stick tests that check the minimum effective concentration (MEC) of the disinfectant solution. Australian guidelines explicitly state that “chemical indicators are to be used to validate concentrations and or holding time… as recommended by the chemical disinfectant manufacturer.” For example, if an AER (Automatic Endoscope Reprocessor) uses OPA solution for high-level disinfection, staff must test the solution with a test strip daily to ensure the OPA percentage is above the MEC since reuse solutions can decay with use. The strip changes color based on the concentration. Only if it passes usually a certain color indicates sufficient concentration can the solution be used; otherwise it must be replaced. Additionally, time indicators or simply the automated cycle timer ensure the item was in contact for the required duration. Some chemical integrators exist that attempt to integrate time and concentration for instance, a sticker that only fully changes color if soaked in disinfectant of at least X percent for Y minutes. These are less common but can serve as a double-check that manual soaks or semi-automated reprocessors are actually achieving the necessary parameters.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>3. Other Indicators &amp; Quality Checks:</strong> Washer-disinfectors also involve water quality indicators, such as hardness test strips or pH strips for final rinse water, since water quality can affect cleaning efficacy and leave residues. While not indicators of the cycle per se, they are part of compliance monitoring. AS 4187 requires monitoring water quality to protect instruments and ensure cleaning agents work properly. There are also indicators for ultrasonic cleaners (foils or cavitation test strips) and for manual cleaning processes like enzyme test kits to see if any protein remains on an instrument after cleaning, which indirectly checks cleaning efficacy. These fall outside the autoclave or washer focus but are part of the overall reprocessing quality system.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In practice, a typical washer-disinfector monitoring regimen per AS/NZS 4187 and local protocols would include: daily or each use cleaning indicator test soil devices in an otherwise empty load to test the washer’s performance independently of actual instruments, routine physical monitoring (printouts of cycle parameters, or at least temperature gauges), and periodic microbiological testing e.g. sampling rinse water for microbial counts, if applicable. Chemical indicators in washers offer immediate visual confirmation that the mechanical cleaning process is effective, much like chemical indicators in autoclaves offer immediate confirmation of a successful sterilisation cycle.</p>
                        <p>One challenge in real-world use of cleaning indicators is ensuring staff use and interpret them correctly. For instance, if a test soil indicator comes out with residual staining, staff need to recognize that as a failure and know how to respond, e.g. take the washer out of service, check for problems, and re-test. If not, there is a risk of “indicator fatigue” (ignoring a failed test because instruments look clean). Training and a blame-free culture of addressing failures are important, a failed cleaning indicator should prompt action just as a failed Bowie-Dick or failed biological test would. In terms of reliability, modern cleaning indicators are designed to be quite tough to clean, they simulate dried blood, which is notoriously hard to remove. So a pass result (completely clean indicator) gives confidence that even tough soils are being removed, whereas a fail result is usually a clear warning. As with sterilisation CIs, these should be used within shelf-life and stored properly (extreme humidity or temperature could alter the test soil consistency). Lab tests vs. field: In the lab, manufacturers test these indicators in calibrated washers to ensure they soil is removable under standard conditions. Field conditions vary, e.g. water pressure fluctuations or slight differences in detergent dosing could make an indicator fail even if instruments still get “visibly” clean. But since any residual organic matter is undesirable, the indicator’s sensitivity is a benefit, erring on the side of caution.</p>
                        <p>Finally, it is worth noting that AS/NZS 4187 and related guidance treat cleaning and sterilising as a continuum, cleaning must be verified because an item that is not clean cannot be assuredly sterilised. Thus, chemical indicators in washers (cleaning phase) and in autoclaves (sterilisation phase) collectively contribute to compliance. Healthcare facilities in Australia are expected to maintain records of these monitoring results e.g. logbooks of daily cleaning indicator results, cycle printouts, chemical and biological indicator outcomes for each load to demonstrate adherence to quality standards.</p>

                        <p class="h3">Conclusion</p>
                        <p>Chemical indicators are indispensable tools in the compliance monitoring arsenal for sterilisation and disinfection processes. In Australian healthcare settings, all six classes of sterilisation chemical indicators (Class 1 to 6) are defined by standards and used according to their intended purposes, from simple process indicators that distinguish processed items, to highly integrative indicators that closely simulate biological lethality. Accuracy and reliability increase with the indicator class: higher classes provide more stringent confirmation that critical parameters were achieved. In real-world use, understanding the limitations of each class is crucial, for instance, a Class 1 tape’s color change confirms exposure, not sterility, and can occur even in suboptimal cycles, whereas a Class 5 integrator offers strong assurance of cycle success but still must be backed up by periodic spore tests. The cost of these indicators varies, and while budget considerations are real, skimping on indicators is penny-wise, pound-foolish given the high stakes of sterilisation failure. Facilities must balance using sufficient monitoring as required by AS/NZS 4187 and recommended by guidelines with managing costs by choosing the right combination of indicators. In practice, using low-cost Class 1 on every item, and strategic use of Class 4 to 6 internally, has become standard. This layered approach provides both the broad compliance (every item marked) and in-depth assurance (internal confirmation of conditions). Meanwhile, washer-disinfectors employ their own suite of chemical indicators to ensure instruments are clean and disinfected: routine cleaning challenge tests, chemical solution test strips, and thermal indicators all contribute to verifying that disinfection equipment performs to standard.</p>
                        <p>In alignment with Australian regulations and standards, any chemical indicators used should be validated and meet the relevant Australian or ISO standard, and results from their use should be documented as part of the quality system. Ultimately, chemical indicators do not work in isolation, they form one part of a comprehensive monitoring strategy, alongside physical monitors (cycle printouts) and biological indicators, to achieve the high level of safety and compliance required in healthcare reprocessing. By carefully selecting appropriate indicator classes for each purpose and rigorously applying them in both laboratory validation and daily routine, facilities can maintain confidence that their autoclaves and washer-disinfectors consistently protect patients from infection.</p>
